##Yello
Yello uses Twilio and Yelp's API to help people with dumbphones find fun things to do around them. Here's how it works (so far):
* Get your phone to send a text message to (323) 248-9357. You can remember this as +1 DAD BIT YELP. I have no idea why Dad would bite Yelp, but these are the risks that come with the job.
* Send a text message like this: "chinese food near 3238 Adeline Street, Oakland CA". You need to put the word "near" in the message, so I know when you stop talking about your search topic and when you start talking about my address.
* Make sure your address is well-formatted. Yelp's search engine is really picky and I haven't made anything more flexible (yet).
* Wait for a response. While waiting, consider that the above example is my real home address. Please do not rob my house while waiting.
* Recieve the business name and location. Walk, drive, bike, or fly your unicorn there.
* Purchase your chinese food. Do not spill General Tso's sauce on your new suit.
